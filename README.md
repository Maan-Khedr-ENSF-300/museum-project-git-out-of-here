## Organization of tasks:
Nessma: Database modification, ER & Relational Diagram, and Browsing Interface

Zahwa: Python interface, Data Entry Interface, and Admin Interface

Kenzy: SQL Querries and Database creation

* ALL did debugging

## NOTES:
- please download the database and enter the user and passwd for your own personal SQL plug. Make sure that the database is imported into your localhost on whatever SQL interface you may be using, use the below as reference

    host = "localhost",
    user = "root", 
    passwd =  ****** ur password 
    database = "ART",
    auth_plugin = "mysql_native_password"

- Note that if any constraints are listed that is because of the parent and child constraints and would require upper level knowledge to elimante
- user names to work around: 
       ('zahwa123', 'sklmP123', 'admin'),
		   ('Kenzy_h','KH!@#',  'dataentry'),
		   ('Nessm_M6789', 'NLOK1gh', 'end')
